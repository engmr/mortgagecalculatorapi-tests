# mortgagecalculatorapi-tests Model
Model should be coming from a nuget package for the MAR.API.MortgageCalculator.Model. The ApiResponse class should be in a domain nuget for all APIs. Until then, the model in the test repo will have to be updated manually.

See https://github.com/engmr/mortgagecalculatorapi/blob/master/MAR.API.MortgageCalculator.Model for more information on this model.
